# Snake

An implementation of the classic snake game.

A compiled version of the game is avilable for MacOs: download [here](https://github.com/vladov3000/snake/raw/master/releases/mac/snake).

Windows and Linux builds are unavailable. Luckily, the code is portable across many operating systems/architectures and is relatively trivial to compile yourself.

Dependencies:
- rust
- cargo
- SDL2

Steps to build:
1. Install the dependences
2. run `cargo build --release` from the topmost folder
3. Your executable will be at `target/release/snake`.
